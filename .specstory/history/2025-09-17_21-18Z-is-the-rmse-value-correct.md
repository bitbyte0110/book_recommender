# Is the RMSE value correct? (2025-09-17 21:18Z)

is this value all normal and correct, or got somthing wrong?1.5628 RMSE

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the terminal output, I can see that the RMSE value of 1.5628 for the Hybrid system (α=0.9) appears to be quite high compared to the other systems. Let me examine the evaluation code to understand if this is normal or if there's an issue.

Now let me examine the specific RMSE calculation in the hybrid filtering method to understand why it's so high:

I can see the issue! Looking at the terminal output and the code, there's a significant problem with the RMSE calculation in the hybrid filtering system. Let me analyze what's happening:

**The Problem:**

1. **RMSE Values Comparison:**
   - Collaborative: 0.4324 RMSE
   - Content-Based: 0.5729 RMSE  
   - Hybrid (α=0.9): **1.5628 RMSE** ← This is abnormally high!

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   Looking at lines 659-660 in the hybrid filtering method:
   ```python
   pred_rating = hybrid_scores[book_idx] * 5.0  # Scale to 1-5 range
   pred_rating = max(1.0, min(5.0, pred_rating))
   ```

   The issue is that `hybrid_scores` are already normalized to the 0-1 range (see line 572: `collab_scores[i] = pred / 5.0  # Normalize to 0-1`), but then the code multiplies by 5.0 again, which is correct. However, the problem lies in how the hybrid scores are calculated.

3. **The Real Issue:**
   Looking at the hybrid scoring logic (lines 574-629), the hybrid system applies multiple enhancement factors:
   - Agreement boost (up to 20% increase)
   - Diversity bonus (10% increase for new items)
   - Popularity boost (5% for highly rated books)
   - Z-score normalization and sigmoid transformation

   These enhancements can push the hybrid scores significantly higher than the original collaborative or content-based scores, leading to over-predictions and thus higher RMSE.

**Is this normal?** 

**No, this is NOT normal.** An RMSE of 1.5628 is quite high for a rating prediction task where ratings are on a 1-5 scale. For comparison:
- Collaborative: 0.4324 RMSE (good)
- Content-Based: 0.5729 RMSE (acceptable)
- Hybrid: 1.5628 RMSE (poor - indicates the model is making large prediction errors)

**The Fix:**

The hybrid system's enhancement factors are too aggressive and are causing over-prediction. The RMSE should be closer to the other systems. You should either:

1. **Reduce the enhancement factors** (agreement boost, diversity bonus, popularity boost)
2. **Remove some of the enhancements** to get a more conservative prediction
3. **Add a final normalization step** to ensure predictions stay within reasonable bounds

The hybrid system is achieving better precision and F1 scores (0.3213 and 0.4693 respectively) but at the cost of much worse rating prediction accuracy (RMSE). This suggests the system is good at ranking items but poor at predicting actual rating values.
